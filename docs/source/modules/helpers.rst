helpers
-------

The helpers module provides high-level functions to simplify the conversion process:
file and folder conversion utilities with various configuration options.

All these functions can be called directly from the root module, ``py2ren``,
without the need to access the ``helpers`` submodule.

    :source: py2ren.helpers
    :directive: autoapifunction
    :items: convert, convfolder, convfile, convertw, convfolderw, convfilew, get_config
